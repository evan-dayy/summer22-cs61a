Q1: How to push a directory (e.g. JAVA). webpage new repo > git clone (local) > git remote add NAME URL (Optional) > git pull NAME main > (How to add up a whole directory or anther repo)
Ans: 1. First directly copy the file into the repo; 2. cd that directory, and $rm -fr .git file; 3. git add --all; 4. git push origin main. [if we directly add another sub-repo by accident, try to $ git rm --cached sub-repo-name]

**Q2: How could I push the git init to a webpage repo? 
Ans: 
Create a repo on the website
$ echo >> readme.md
$git init
$git add .
$git commit m ""
$git remote add origin URL [add origin] / $git remote add other repo URL [add others] 

$git push origin main
$git pull others main [can use --allow-unrelated-histories to force]

Q3: What is branch? How does it work? Difference between main and master? [New name can set by $ git branch -m NAME] What is the difference between git push and git push origin main [BTW, what does origin mean]
Ans: The difference is similar, git push's default is git push origin main

Q4: How to remove a git? 
Ans: we can use the $ ls -a to see the hidden file; use $ rm -fr .git to remove the git repo.

Q5: Staging area only have one version of the file, the most recent add snapshot.

Q6: Why we need add and commit in two step rather in two steps.
